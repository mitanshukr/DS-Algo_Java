# Data Structure and Algorithm with Java

I made this repository while learning Data Structure and Algorithms. This is my small contribution to Github community and I must say this repository will gonna help every beginner and Programming lovers to learn the very basics of Data structure and Algorithms.

_**Note**: This repository contains basics of Data Structure and Algorithm._
_Suggestions are welcome!_

## Arrays

1) [Basic Array Functions](https://example.com/)  (Insertion, getElement, Search, Sort, etc.)
2) [Find duplicate Elements in the array](https://example.com/) 
3) [Rotational Array](https://example.com/) 
4) [Find max. and min. Element in the array](https://example.com) 
## Linked Lists 
- **Singular Linked List**
1) [Creation, Insertion, and Traversal](https://example.com/) 
2) [Searching an Element](https://example.com/) 
3) [Updating a node](https://example.com/) 
4) [Deletion of an Element](https://example.com/) 
5) Reversal of a linked list
6) Sorting a linked list and other Implimentations
7) Merging two sorted Linked List
8) Polynomial Arithmetic with Linked List 
- **Doubly Linked List**
1) [Creation, Insertion, and Traversal](https://example.com/) 
2) [Deletion of an Element](https://example.com/) 
3) Reversal of a Double Linked List
4) [Traversal Challenge](https://example.com/)  (Two steps forward & One step backward)
- **Circular Linked List**
1) [Creation, Insertion, and Traversal](https://example.com/) 
2) [Deletion of an Element](https://example.com/) 
3) [Searching an Element](https://example.com/) 
4) Reversal of a Circular Linked List

## Stacks and Queues
- **Stacks**
1) [Array Implimentation of Stack](https://example.com/) 
2) [Linked List Implimentation of Stack](https://example.com/) 
3) [Dynamic Array Implimentation of Stack](https://example.com/) 
4) Stack Implimentation using Queue
5) Applications of Stack

 - **Queues**
1) [Array Implimentation of Queue](https://example.com/) (Circular Queue)
2) [Linked List Implimentation of Queue](https://example.com/) 
3) Queue Implimentation using Stack
- **Deque**
- **Priority Queue**

## Trees
- **Binary Trees**
1) Array Representation of Binary Tree
2) Linked List Representation of Binary Tree
-- Creation of Binary Tree
-- Recursive Traversal (PreOrder, Inorder, PostOrder)
-- Non- Recursive Traversal (PreOrder, Inorder, PostOrder)
-- Level Order traversal
6) Insertion/Deletion/Searching
7) Height of a Binary Tree

- **Binary Search Trees**
